I am Sweta, a senior member of technical staff at the [Machine Learning Research Group, Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:49:::::P49_PROJECT_ID:7).  Previously, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Vanderbilt University](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/eecs/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yevgeniy Vorobeychik](http://vorobeychik.com/). I graduated with B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).  

My current research is on machine learning and algorithmic fairness. My broad research interests include computational game theory, large-scale stochastic planning problems: markov decision processes (MDPs), machine learning, optimization, reinforcement learning, multiagent systems and artificial intelligence.
